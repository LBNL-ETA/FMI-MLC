#### Functional Mock-up Interface - Machine Learning Center

This package simplifies the use of Functional Mock-Up Interface compliant models for Machine Learning and Simulation purposes.

## General
The interfacing of simulation models with machine learning algorithms such as [reinforcement learing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is complex and requires custom software bindings. FMI-MLC seeks to bridge this gap by employing the [Funcitional Mock-Up Interface (FMI)](https://fmi-standard.org/), an industry standard to export and interface with simulation models, and [OpenAI's Gym](https://fmi-standard.org/), a standard Python interface for machine learning.

*Please note that the FMI-MLC package is still under active development. Please open an issue for specific questions*

## Getting Started
The following link permits users to clone the source directory containing the [FMI-MLC](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/FMI-MLC) package. The package can then be installed using `pip install .` within the directory. While a user can provide a custom FMU handler, it is recommended to also install [PyFMI](https://github.com/modelon-community/PyFMI). FMI-MLC will default to PyFMI if no custom handler is provided.

## Example
To illustrate the functionality of FMI-MLC, example Jupyter notebooks can be found [here](examples).
